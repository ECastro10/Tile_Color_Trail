This is the tile color trailer.
The idea is simple, click on the button, populate the screen with tiles, then whenever the mouse hovers over a tile, the color of the tile will change until it is done hovering over that tile.

requirements:
Django (1.11.2)
pip (9.0.1)
pytz (2017.2)
setuptools (36.0.1)
wheel (0.29.0)
